Being able to reuse battle-tested code that is developed and used throughout the company leaves teams more time to think about Domain level responsibilities and worry less about lower level aspects like browser support, accessibility, performance or compatibility. Again, this is not about imposing technologies on everyone but more about setting up a process of finding the least common denominator while abstracting away technical details and defining conventions and interfaces."
